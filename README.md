## Git merging commands

- Make sure you are in the main branch `git checkout main`
- Fetch code from the repo and merges it into our local main branch `git pull origin main`
- To preserve the main branch, if we're working on a new feature, create a new branch `git checkout -b new_feature`
- Create your files and then add them to new branch `git add .`
- Commit the new changes `git commit -m "new changes"`
- FIRST push to new remote branch `git push -u origin new_feature`
###

- Click **Compare & Pull request**
- If we want to merge, click **create pull request**
- You can then **request a review** and assign people to review it
- Click on **Merge pull request** if changes are good
- After the merge, you can **delete the branch** on GitHub
